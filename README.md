## Introduction

The IPL Score Prediction System is a deep learning-based project that aims to predict the final score of IPL cricket matches. It utilizes historical match data, player statistics, and various machine learning algorithms to make predictions.

## Tools Used

- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab: We used Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab for developing and testing our machine learning models.

- Visual Studio: Visual Studio was used for code development, version control, and project management.

## Technology Stack

- **Machine Learning**: We employ traditional machine learning techniques for feature engineering and data preprocessing.

- **Deep Learning**: Deep Learning models, particularly neural networks built using TensorFlow, play a crucial role in making accurate score predictions.

- **Flask (Front-end integration)**: Flask is used to create a user-friendly front-end for interacting with the prediction system.

**Libraries Used**:

- NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning tools and evaluation.
- TensorFlow: For building deep learning models.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.

## Project Overview

Our project involves several key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering historical IPL match data, player statistics, and other relevant data from various sources.

2. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**: Analyzing the collected data to understand its structure and cleaning it by handling missing values, outliers, and other data anomalies.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the data for modeling by performing feature engineering, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

4. **Model Development**: Building machine learning and deep learning models to predict IPL match scores. Various algorithms and architectures are explored to find the best-performing model.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2).

1. **Data Collection**: We gather historical IPL data, player statistics, and match details.

2. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**: We analyze and clean the data to ensure its quality and consistency.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Data is preprocessed to make it suitable for model training.

4. **Model Development**: Machine learning and deep learning models are built and trained on the preprocessed data.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The models are evaluated for their prediction accuracy.

6. **Outcome Prediction**: The trained model is used to predict the outcome of IPL matches.
